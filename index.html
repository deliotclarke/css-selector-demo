        <h2>Movie Details</h2>
        <p>Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is an orphaned teenager who lives with her Auntie Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle
            Henry (Charley Grapewin) on a Kansas farm in the early 1900s. She daydreams about going "over the rainbow"
            after Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton), a nasty neighbor, hits Dorothy's dog Toto (Terry) on the back with a
            rake, causing Toto to bite her. Miss Gulch shows up with an order to take Toto to the sheriff to be
            euthanized, but Toto jumps out of the basket on the back of Miss Gulch's bicycle and runs back to Dorothy.
            Fearing that Miss Gulch, who does not know that Toto has escaped, will return, Dorothy takes the dog and
            runs away from home. She meets an itinerant phony fortune teller, Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan), who
            immediately guesses that Dorothy has run away. Pretending to tell her fortune and wishing to reunite Dorothy
            with her aunt, he tells her that Auntie Em has fallen ill from worry over her.</p>
        <p>Dorothy immediately returns home with Toto, only to find a tornado approaching. Unable to reach her family in
            their storm cellar, Dorothy enters the house, is knocked unconscious by a loose window, and apparently
            begins to dream. Along with her house and Toto, she's swept from her sepia-toned world to the magical,
            beautiful, dangerous and technicolor land of Oz. The tornado drops Dorothy's house on the Wicked Witch of
            the East, killing her. The witch ruled the Land of the Munchkins, little people who think at first that
            Dorothy herself must be a witch. The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton again), who is the sister
            of the dead witch, threatens Dorothy. But Glinda (Billie Burke), the Good Witch of the North, gives Dorothy
            the dead witch's enchanted Ruby Slippers, and the slippers protect her. Glinda advises that if Dorothy wants
            to go home to Kansas, she should seek the aid of the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City. To get
            there, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road. </p>

            <h2>Ruby Slippers</h2>
            <p>The ruby slippers are the magic pair of shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the 1939
                MGM musical movie The Wizard of Oz. Because of their iconic stature,[1] the ruby slippers are among the
                most valuable items of film memorabilia.[2] A number of pairs were made for the film, though the exact
                number is unknown. Five pairs are known to have survived; one pair was stolen from a museum in 2005 and
                recovered in 2018.</p>

            <p>Toto is a fictional dog in L. Frank Baum's Oz series of children's books, and works derived from them. His name is pronounced with a long "O", a homophone of "toe toe". He was originally a small terrier drawn by W. W. Denslow for the first edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). He reappears in numerous adaptations, such as The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Wiz (1978) and Return to Oz (1985). The breed is cairn terrier.</p>
